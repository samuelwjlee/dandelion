# Why
In this modern age of computing, people often own more than one computing machine or switch to a different computing device more frequently than others. Setting up local environments every time from scratch can be a bit cumbersome. So this repository is to have a central location to manage and seed one's setup with one command in any machine running MacOS.

# What
Setup files that could be managed remotely and applied to any machine running MacOS.

# How
1. Update setup files in this repo as you prefer.

2. Run this command in your terminal 👇🏼
```
cd /path_to_this_repo
sh apply_setup.sh
```

3. Your setup files are created/updated in your local machine automatically 🎉
