# Why
In this modern age of computing, people often own more than one computing device (work and personal) or switch to a different device more frequently. But setting up local environment to one's liking every time from scratch can be a bit cumbersome. So `Dandelion` is created to have a central location to manage and seed one's setup on any machine with a single command.

# What
Setup files that could be managed remotely and applied to any machine running MacOS.

# How
1. Update setup files in this repo as you prefer.

2. Run this command in your terminal 👇🏼
```
cd /path_to_this_repo
sh apply_setup.sh
```

3. Your setup files are created/updated in your local machine automatically 🎉
